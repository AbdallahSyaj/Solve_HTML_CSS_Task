    <h3>Sports is a large global business.</h3>
    <p>Billions of dollars are spent at sporting events, on sports teams, on sports events, as well as on sports-related equipment and apparel. This guide is devoted to those sports that are the largest in terms of monies at the professional level and, as a result, not every sport is included. The primary focus is on the professional sports industry in the United States although there are a few instances in which the international aspects of the industry are mentioned. Because of the focus on professional sports, the Olympics and amateur events are not included.</p>

    <h3>What is a healthy diet?</h3>
    <p>Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving yourself of the foods you love. Rather, it's about <span style="font-weight: bold;">feeling great</span>, having more energy, improving your health, and boosting your mood.</p>

    <p>While some extreme diets may suggest otherwise, we all need a balance of protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, vitamins, and minerals in our diets to sustain a healthy body. You don't need to eliminate certain categories of food from your diet, but rather select the healthiest options from each category. Using <span style="font-weight: bold;">fruit</span> / <span style="font-weight: bold;">vegetables</span> / <span style="font-weight: bold;">legumes</span> (e.g. lentils).</p>
